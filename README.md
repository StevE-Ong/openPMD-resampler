# :electron: openPMD-Resampler
Resampling tools for `openPMD` PIC data

## :bulb: Motivation

We often need to post-process the particle data from a PIC simulation, and pass it to additional tracking codes like [`GEANT`](#atom_symbol-geant4), [`GPT`](https://www.pulsar.nl/gpt/), [`SIMION`](https://simion.com) or [`Wake-T`](https://github.com/AngelFP/Wake-T). The original dataset can correspond to several **billion** particles, so one needs to reduce it to a manageable size, while conserving the main features of the underlying physics. This repository implements several resampling methods from the literature [[2]](#books-references), as well as a comprehensive suite of high-resolution [visualization](./plots/phase_space.png) tools, based on [Datashader](https://datashader.org).

## :rocket: Installation

```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/berceanu/openPMD-resampler.git#egg=openpmd_resampler
```

## :book: Usage

For an overview of the main functionality, see the [`usage.py`](./usage.py) example script and its [output](./output.md):

```console
$ python usage.py <path_to_your_openPMD_file>
```

Replace descriptions between chevrons `<>` by relevant values, in this case the path to the PIC output file.
If you need a sample PIC output file for testing, you can download [lwfa.h5](https://transfer.sequanium.de/qjhu1I2t56/lwfa.h5) [212M].

The code works with `openPMD`-compatible PIC codes, such as [`WarpX`](https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX), [`PIConGPU`](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu), [`fbpic`](https://github.com/fbpic/fbpic), etc.

The runtime is under one minute on an *M1 MacBook Air* and the memory footprint is ~1 GB RAM.

The output is a CSV text file, of the following form:

```
position_x_um (μm), position_y_um (μm), position_z_um (μm), momentum_x_mev_c (MeV/c), momentum_y_mev_c (MeV/c), momentum_z_mev_c (MeV/c)
1.1201412540356980e+01,8.0062201241442832e-01,3.9551004545608885e+03,-9.1752357482910156e+00,-1.4616233825683594e+01,2.9899465942382812e+02
...
```

## :wrench: Development

All project dependencies are listed under [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

After installing your favorite `Python` distribution, for example [`micromamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/micromamba-installation.html#umamba-install), create a new environment:

```console
$ micromamba env create -f environment.yml
$ micromamba activate openpmd_resampler_env
```

Clone the repo and run: 

```console
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

To start from scratch:

```console
$ micromamba deactivate
$ micromamba env remove -n openpmd_resampler_env
```

## :atom_symbol: GEANT4

For a computational estimate, here is a quote from Ref. [1]:

> The computer system for [`GEANT4`](https://geant4.web.cern.ch) simulation is made up of Intel Quad-core 2.66 GHz CPU and 12 GB DDR3 RAM and OS is Ubuntu 9.04 server version. It took about 3~4 hours to simulate with $10^7$ primary particles.
